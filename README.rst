FilterPype
==========

FilterPype is being used for multi-level data analysis, but could be applied to 
many other areas where it is difficult to split up a system into small 
independent parts.

Some of its features:

* Advanced algorithms broken down into simple data filter coroutines
* Pipelines constructed from filters in the new FilterPype? mini-language
* Domain experts assemble pipelines with no Python knowledge required
* Sub-pipelines and filters linked by automatic pipeline construction
* All standard operations available: branching, joining and looping
* Recursive coroutine pipes allowing calculation of e.g. factorials
* Using it is like writing a synchronous multi-threaded program
* Package requires setuptools for installation.
